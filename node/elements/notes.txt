upg:

	nimble --bootstrap (or --no-bootstrap) .. if folder empty?  (global config possible?)

	system to watch for changes to source files and run nimble build on changes

	bundle live-server? https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server -- run via api.

	(optionally: nimble --bootstrap)  .. generates example framework in current directly.. (ask if dir isn't empty)

	upg: copy media to ./build/media/	//upg: option to include media to this.media['name'] as dataurl and or option as blob. into bundle.js or other options? (lib hook to install to indexedDB?)

	upg: bundle bundle.js into local index.html file.

	upg: support for service worker? (perhaps a dual app? .. installer/loader app, and loaded updateable indexedDB app?)



nimble-node-element
	- add propery change and such events accessable to created.
	- add hook for decendant setting
	- upg: auto dependentcies so can nest/reuse.

perhaps nimble node elements should be it's own project (instead of all the node versions) .. upg: split nimble versions to single target projects? (how to do that cascade reference like?) .. perhaps only in npm have it seperate?
